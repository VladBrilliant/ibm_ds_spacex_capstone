# ☕ Java Engineering

This directory contains **Java-based engineering experiments and utilities**.

The goal of this area is to explore how JVM-based tools and languages can
complement Python-centric Data Science workflows, especially in areas where
strong typing, performance, or long-running services are beneficial.

## Focus Areas

- Java utilities for data processing or validation
- Experimental Java-based monitoring or analytics tools
- Cross-language integration ideas (Python ↔ Java)
- Early prototypes that may later evolve into standalone components

## Status

This directory currently serves as a **sandbox for future extensions**.
Implementations will be added incrementally as the project evolves.

## Relation to the Project

Java components here are **not required** for running the core project.
They exist to demonstrate engineering breadth and system-level thinking.
